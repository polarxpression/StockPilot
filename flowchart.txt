This flowchart illustrates a **Battery Management System Restock Flowchart** that determines how to handle battery inventory restocking based on specific conditions.

## Flow Description

**Starting Point:**
The process begins at the "Start" node and immediately branches into two main pathways based on the first decision point.

**Primary Decision - Battery Quantity Check:**
The first diamond asks: *"Is the battery quantity in the gondola less than half the maximum gondola limit?"*

- **If No (sufficient stock):** The process ends immediately, indicating no restocking action is needed.

- **If Yes (low stock):** The system proceeds to check stock availability.

**Secondary Decision - Stock Availability:**
The next diamond asks: *"Is there in stock?"*

- **If Yes (stock available):** 
  - The process moves to "Add to the restock suggestions"
  - Then calculates batteries needed by subtracting the gondola limit by their current quantity
  - Finally applies the calculation to restock and ends

- **If No (no stock available):**
  - Leads to a third decision point asking: *"Is the external battery in more than one gondola?"*

**Tertiary Decision - Multiple Gondola Check:**
This diamond determines if the external battery appears in multiple locations:

- **If Yes (multiple gondolas):**
  - Calculates batteries needed by subtracting the sum of both gondolas' limits from both gondolas' current quantity
  - Applies calculation to restock external purchase
  - Ends

- **If No (single gondola):**
  - Routes to "Add to the restock external purchase"
  - Calculates batteries needed by subtracting the gondola limit by their current quantity
  - Applies calculation to restock external purchase
  - Ends
